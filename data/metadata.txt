data/preCropNet.h5: 
3499 sampled frames from 168 SWF415/ SWF702/ SWF1088 hermaphoridtes across prj_kfc, prj_5ht, prj_rim, prj_starvation and prj_aversion. 
Head positions are uncropped to match the 322x210 dimension. 
~30 frames are sampled from each animal
See notebooks/generate_preCropNet_data_from_data_dict.ipynb for julia code that generated preCropNet.h5.

data/immob_preCropNet.h5:
381 sampled frames from a subset of immobilized multichannel images across prj_kfc, prj_5ht, prj_rim, prj_starvation and prj_aversion.
Head positions are uncropped to match the 322x210 dimension. 
Only t=30 (i.e. 1 frame) is taken to avoid redundancy since all immobilized images are functionally identical.
See notebooks/generate_preCropNet_immobilized_data_from_data_dict.ipynb for julia code that generated immob_preCropNet.h5.

data/preCropNet_cropped.h5 and data/immob_preCropNet_cropped.h5: 
Images and labels from preCropNet.h5 and immob_preCropNet.h5 were passed through CropNet to yield in the standard dimension of (284,120).
Out of 3499 frames in preCropNet.h5, 15 frames had wrong labels and were discarded before being passed through CropNet and saved in preCropNet_cropped.h5
See notebooks/CropNet_2D.ipynb for julia code that generated preCropNet_cropped.h5 and immob_preCropNet_cropped.h5.

====================================================

data/postCropNet.h5:
1675 sampled frames from 22 heterogeneous animals -- 5 SWF360 hermaphrodites, 1 SWF467 hermaphrodite, 3 SWF702 hermaphrodites, 7 SWF1212 hermaphrodites and 6 SWF1088/ SWF1212 males.
Among them, 11 animals were imaged with Zyla4.2P, and 11 animals were images with Hamamatsu Orca Fusion BT2.
~80 frames are sampled from each animal, with both positive and negative examples.
Labels come directly from ImageClick outputs.
Both images and labels are in standard dimension (284, 120) from the get-go.
See notebooks/generate_postCropNet_data_from_imageClick.ipynb for python code that generated postCropNet.h5.

data/immob_postCropNet.h5:
30 sampled frames from a subset of immobilized multichannel images, with the vast majority imaged with Hamamatsu Orca Fusion BT2. 
Only t=30 (i.e. 1 frame) is taken to avoid redundancy since all immobilized images are functionally identical.
See notebooks/generate_postCropNet_immobilized_data_from_data_dict.ipynb for julia code that generated immob_postCropNet.h5.

====================================================

Data that go into network training/ validation/ testing are all in the standard dimension of (284,120):
data/preCropNet_cropped.h5
data/immob_preCropNet_cropped.h5
data/postCropNet.h5
data/immob_postCropNet.h5

Total 3484 + 381 + 1675 + 30 = 5570 unique image-label pairs from 190 animals.

====================================================

For future retraining (as new strains/ imaging conditions emerge):
Provided that CropNet-processed images are labelled with ImageClick, additional training data can be generated from re-running notebook/generate_postCropNet_data_from_imageClick.ipynb, which takes in ImageClick-generated CSV files and outputs another HDF5 file of image-label pairs.

Manual inspection of each image-label pair in the new HDF5 is highly recommended. An efficient way to do so is to convert the image-label pairs in the new HDF5 into a directory of PNGs using notebook/save_as_pngs.ipynb, downloading the directory to your local machine, and quickly click through each overlaid frame on your local image viewer.

Then append the path to new HDF5 into list_path_h5 in config.yaml to have the new data used as train/val/test split as defined by frac_val and frac_test.
